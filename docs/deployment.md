# Deployment guide

Run the server on a Linux host with systemd, then choose how clients reach it. Steps 1-3
(install, configure, systemd) are common to every host-based setup. Step 4 is the only
part that depends on your environment: it gives the server a public HTTPS URL that
forwards to its local HTTP port. Clients on the same machine can skip step 4, see
[Local-only use](#local-only-use-no-public-url) and
[Native stdio](#native-stdio-transport).

## Choose a deployment

Where does your Claude client run?

- **Claude.ai (web), Claude mobile and Cowork** are cloud-hosted. Anthropic's servers
  make the OAuth calls and every tool call, so `127.0.0.1` on your machine is
  unreachable for them. They need a **public HTTPS URL** and `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`.
- **Claude Desktop and Claude Code on the same machine** can reach `localhost`, so they
  need no public URL and no password. See
  [why a cloud connector cannot use local mode](#why-a-cloud-hosted-connector-cannot-use-it).

| Option | Prerequisites | Exposure and authentication | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Existing reverse proxy or shared Nextcloud host](#reuse-another-existing-nextcloud-proxy) | A proxy you already run with TLS on the same host, a new subdomain such as `organizer.example.com` | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Not tested (nginx, Traefik) |
| [Path on the Nextcloud hostname](#serve-under-a-path-on-the-nextcloud-hostname) | A proxy for the Nextcloud hostname that can strip a path prefix and forward three root-level discovery paths | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (local Caddy with a real Nextcloud container and the MCP SDK client; no public run, no Claude.ai) |
| [New public server with Caddy](#caddy-on-the-same-host) | A host with a public IP, inbound ports 80 and 443, a DNS name | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (local Caddy only, no public run) |
| [Cloudflare Tunnel](#4c-alternative-cloudflare-tunnel) | A domain on Cloudflare. No inbound ports, works behind CGNAT | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (quick tunnel and scripted client; standalone `GET /mcp` stream failed on the quick tunnel) |
| [Tailscale Funnel](#4b-expose-via-tailscale-funnel) | A Tailscale account with Funnel enabled for the node | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Supported, tested with claude.ai |
| [Local HTTP](#local-only-use-no-public-url) | Client on the same machine, Node.js for `mcp-remote` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` only, no password. Any local process can obtain a token | Supported, tested with `mcp-remote` |
| [Native stdio](#native-stdio-transport) | Client on the same machine that can start a process | No port, no OAuth. The client starts the server | Supported, automated tests; client configs not run by the maintainers |

"Supported" means the setup has been verified end to end. "Partially tested" and "Not
tested" recipes should work but are not confirmed, and each says so in its own section.
The [evidence matrix](deployment-verification.md#evidence-matrix) records what was
checked per recipe.

### Example names in this guide

These names are used consistently. Replace them with your own.

| Name | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cloud.example.com` | Your Nextcloud, used for `NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL` |
| `organizer.example.com` | This server's public hostname, used for `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` |
| `<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net` | Your Funnel hostname, which Tailscale assigns |

### `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` versus the connector URL

`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is the bare origin clients use: scheme and host, **without** `/mcp`,
for example `https://organizer.example.com`. A
[subpath deployment](#serve-under-a-path-on-the-nextcloud-hostname) adds its prefix,
for example `https://cloud.example.com/organizer`. The server builds its OAuth discovery
URLs from it, so a mismatch breaks the OAuth flow. The **connector URL** you enter in
Claude is `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` plus the MCP path: `https://organizer.example.com/mcp`.
Local HTTP uses `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the endpoint
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`. Native stdio needs neither.

```text
Clients ── HTTPS ──► existing reverse proxy
                         ├─ cloud.example.com     ──► Nextcloud
                         └─ organizer.example.com ──► MCP (127.0.0.1:8000)
                                                        │
                                  Nextcloud ◄── HTTPS + app password
```

The server's [OAuth authentication](authentication.md) protects the public endpoint.
Plain `tailscale serve` only reaches your tailnet; Funnel makes it public.

Every recipe is verified with the same [checklist](deployment-verification.md), which
separates local automated proxy checks from a real public client/Nextcloud
deployment and lists what has not been tested.

## 1. Install on the host

*Common to every host-based setup.*

```bash
# as a dedicated user, e.g. "mcp"
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # install uv if not present
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.git
cd nextcloud-organizer-mcp
uv sync --locked --no-dev
```

`--no-dev` skips pytest/ruff, which aren't needed at runtime.

## 2. Configure

*Common to every host-based setup. Local HTTP and stdio need fewer settings, see their sections.*

Create `/etc/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.env` (root-owned, mode `600` — it contains secrets):

```bash
NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=<nextcloud user>
NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD=<app password from Settings -> Security>

# Optional. Only needed when the CalDAV endpoint is not <base>/remote.php/dav/
# (both URLs must point at the same Nextcloud instance).
# NEXTCLOUD_CALDAV_URL=https://cloud.example.com/remote.php/dav/

# Must match the public HTTPS origin exactly (scheme + host, no /mcp), set up in step 4a,
# 4b or 4c. For Funnel use https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net instead. A subpath
# deployment adds its prefix: https://cloud.example.com/organizer.
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://organizer.example.com

# Required for any non-localhost PUBLIC_BASE_URL, or if MCP_HOST below is
# bound to a non-local address - the server refuses to start without it in
# either case. This is the actual security gate on the OAuth /authorize step
# now that the server is reachable from the public internet; the
# redirect-domain allow-list alone does not stop a scripted client from
# self-issuing a token. See docs/authentication.md.
MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD=<long random value>

# OAuth client/token state persists here across restarts - must be writable
# by the "mcp" user. Matches the systemd StateDirectory set up below.
MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/oauth-state

MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
MCP_PORT=8000

# Uvicorn trusts forwarded headers only from this local proxy peer.
# This matches the Caddy upstream 127.0.0.1:8000 below.
FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=127.0.0.1
```

Generate the OAuth password with:

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(24))"
```

> **How the password gate works (D2 - resolved 2026-07-10).** Earlier revisions checked
> `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` against the OAuth `state` query parameter of the `/authorize`
> request and flagged it as an unverified assumption whether claude.ai could ever
> deliver the password that way. That assumption was then tested against production
> claude.ai (real **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** flow, `/authorize`

> input that could influence it, and every legitimate authorization was denied with
> "Registration with the authentication service failed" (fail-closed - no exposure, but
> no way to ever register the connector either).
>
> The `state` check has been replaced by an **interactive consent page** (LOCAL PATCH 5
> in `personal_auth.py`): `/authorize` parks the validated OAuth request in memory under
> a cryptographically random single-use pending key (10-minute TTL) and 302-redirects
> the browser to `GET /consent`, which serves a password form. `POST /consent` verifies
> the password in constant time (`secrets.compare_digest`), then mints the authorization
> code and redirects back to Claude's `redirect_uri` with the code and Claude's own
> `state` intact. During connector setup you will therefore see a password prompt served
> by this server - enter `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` there.
>
> Because the form is a publicly reachable password prompt, it is rate-limited: max 5
> wrong attempts per pending key (then the key is invalidated and the flow must be
> restarted from Claude), max 10 failures per client IP per 15 minutes (then a hard
> `429`, even with the correct password). Submitted form data is never logged and never
> echoed into responses, and the server keeps Uvicorn's HTTP access log disabled (see
> [Authentication](authentication.md)) - that now guards the pending
> keys in `/consent` query strings rather than the password itself.

## 3. systemd service

*Common to every host-based setup. The service also holds OAuth state under its state directory, so tokens survive restarts.*

`/etc/systemd/system/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Organizer MCP for Nextcloud
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple

RestartSec=5

# basic hardening, cheap and non-intrusive

ReadWritePaths=/home/mcp/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/.venv

StateDirectory=nextcloud-organizer-mcp

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nextcloud-organizer-mcp
sudo systemctl status nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

## 4. Expose the server

Steps 4a, 4b and 4c are alternatives: pick one. Each provides public TLS and forwards to
`127.0.0.1:8000`. Skip step 4 for a client on the same machine.

## 4a. Expose via Caddy or an existing proxy

> **Verification status: partially tested - feedback wanted.** This recipe should
> work, but it has **not** been tested end to end: no publicly reachable Caddy
> deployment, external Claude client or distinct public client IPs were available.

> or on issue [#70](https://github.com/Vando-sketch/Nextcloud-Organizer-MCP/issues/70).
> The [public deployment checklist](deployment-verification.md#shared-checklist)
> lists what to check.

### Caddy on the same host

Use a dedicated hostname such as `organizer.example.com`, alongside the existing
`cloud.example.com` Nextcloud site. Caddy and MCP must share the host network
for `127.0.0.1:8000` to reach MCP. Container networking is a separate deployment
choice; see [#64](https://github.com/Vando-sketch/Nextcloud-Organizer-MCP/issues/64).

Point the new hostname's DNS A/AAAA records at the proxy. For this default
recipe, allow inbound TCP ports 80 and 443 to Caddy and keep its certificate
storage writable and persistent. Caddy provisions and renews public
certificates and redirects HTTP to HTTPS.
[Caddy automatic HTTPS documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https)

Add the site block and runtime log filter to `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` (also
available as [examples/Caddyfile](../examples/Caddyfile)). If the file already
has a global options block, merge these `log default` settings into it; Caddy
accepts only one global block. Preserve existing default logging settings
when adding the filter.

```caddyfile
{
    log default {
        format filter {
            wrap json
            fields {
                request>uri delete
                request>headers>Referer delete
            }
        }
    }
}

organizer.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

Keep your existing Nextcloud site block and its backend configuration. If
another proxy already owns ports 80/443, add the MCP hostname there using the
adaptation guidance below, or plan a migration before starting Caddy.

Validate the complete configuration and reload the existing Caddy service:

```bash
sudo caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile
sudo systemctl reload caddy
sudo systemctl restart nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://organizer.example.com`, without `/mcp`, in step 2.
The connector URL is **`https://organizer.example.com/mcp`**.

### Routes, client IPs and streaming

Route the **whole hostname**, preserving paths, query strings, methods and bodies.
The server serves `/mcp`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, OAuth
protected-resource discovery at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`
(use the URL in `/mcp`'s `WWW-Authenticate` challenge), `/register`,
`/authorize`, `/consent` (GET and POST), and `/token`.
Proxying only `/mcp` leaves discovery and consent unreachable. Prefer a subdomain;
a path on the Nextcloud hostname works with the extra routing described in
[Serve under a path on the Nextcloud hostname](#serve-under-a-path-on-the-nextcloud-hostname).

Caddy preserves `Host`, sets `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and
`X-Forwarded-Host`, and ignores client-supplied values for those forwarded
headers by default. It immediately flushes `text/event-stream` responses;
`stream_timeout` has no default limit. The recipe needs no custom header or
buffering directives.
[Caddy reverse proxy documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy)

`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=127.0.0.1` is Uvicorn's environment setting for the trusted
proxy peer. It allows the local Caddy connection to supply the original client
IP and HTTPS scheme. Consent's per-IP rate limit uses that client address.
Keep MCP bound to loopback and trust only the actual proxy peer; never set
`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=*` for an exposed backend.
[Uvicorn settings](https://uvicorn.dev/settings/#http)

For a CDN or another proxy in front of Caddy, configure trust at every hop for
the actual upstream proxy addresses and repeat the client-IP checks below.
Do not broadly trust private networks as a substitute for identifying the proxy.

### Reuse another existing Nextcloud proxy

Add a virtual host for `organizer.example.com` with your proxy's normal public
TLS configuration and an HTTP upstream of `127.0.0.1:8000`. Preserve the entire
hostname's routes and original host, forward the HTTPS scheme, and replace
untrusted client-supplied forwarding headers with the actual client address.
Set `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` to the peer address MCP really sees if it differs from
the same-host loopback example, and restrict network access to that backend.

Check response buffering and any request/response or idle deadlines inherited
from your existing configuration. MCP uses Streamable HTTP, including SSE;
responses must reach the client incrementally and long-lived streams must not
be cut off by a short proxy deadline. Test through every proxy hop using the
[shared checklist](deployment-verification.md). nginx/Traefik configurations
remain unverified here; verify them with the shared checklist before publishing
copyable recipes.

### Serve under a path on the Nextcloud hostname

If you cannot add a subdomain, the server can run under a path such as
`https://cloud.example.com/organizer` next to Nextcloud. Set
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com/organizer`; the connector URL is
`https://cloud.example.com/organizer/mcp`.

The proxy needs three rules for the Nextcloud hostname, ahead of Nextcloud's own:

1. **Strip the prefix.** Forward `/organizer/*` to `127.0.0.1:8000` with `/organizer`
   removed. The server's routes are `/mcp`, `/authorize`, `/consent` and so on;
   forwarding `/organizer/mcp` unchanged gives `404`.
2. **Forward the issuer's discovery paths unchanged.** OAuth discovery for an issuer
   with a path lives at the domain root, with the path after `/.well-known/`
   ([RFC 8414](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8414#section-3.1),
   [RFC 9728](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9728#section-3.1)):
   `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/organizer`,
   `/.well-known/openid-configuration/organizer` and
   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/organizer/mcp`. The server answers these
   exact paths when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` has a path.
3. **Send everything else to Nextcloud,** including its own `/.well-known/` paths.

With Caddy (also in [examples/Caddyfile.subpath](../examples/Caddyfile.subpath),
together with the log filter from the subdomain recipe):

```caddyfile
cloud.example.com {
    handle_path /organizer/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
    }

    @organizer_discovery path /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/organizer /.well-known/openid-configuration/organizer /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/organizer/*
    handle @organizer_discovery {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
    }

    handle {
        # your existing Nextcloud directives
    }
}
```

For nginx, Nextcloud's recommended configuration has a `location ^~ /.well-known`
block. Put exact `location =` blocks for the discovery paths before it, and a
`location /organizer/` block whose `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000/;` ends in a
slash so nginx strips the prefix. This nginx variant is not tested.

Limits compared to a subdomain:

- **Old clients cannot discover it.** Clients that follow the MCP authorization
  spec from 2025-06-18 on read the `401` challenge and find the paths above. Clients
  that only know the 2025-03-26 rules look for `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
  and `/register` at the domain root, which belong to Nextcloud, and fail.
- **One browser origin.** The consent page shares an origin with Nextcloud, and the
  browser sends Nextcloud's cookies along to `/organizer/` paths. The server ignores
  them, but a subdomain keeps the two apps isolated.
- **Verification status.** Tested with a local Caddy 2.11.4 over plain HTTP in front of
  a real Nextcloud 35.0.1 container: the MCP Python SDK 2.2.0 OAuth client found the
  server from the challenge, passed the consent page under the prefix, and called
  `list_task_lists` against Nextcloud. Public TLS and the claude.ai connector have not
  been tested on a subpath; please report results on
  [#73](https://github.com/Vando-sketch/Nextcloud-Organizer-MCP/issues/73).

### Protect OAuth request parameters in proxy logs

The example does not enable site HTTP access logging. Caddy still emits runtime
errors: a failed upstream request can produce a `502` error log containing the
request URI and `Referer` header. Either may contain `/consent?pending=...` or
other OAuth parameters. The global default log filter removes these fields
while retaining the error itself. This filter applies to default runtime logs
across all sites, so review its effect on your existing Nextcloud logging.
[Caddy global logging options](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/options#log)

Audit imported snippets, separately configured access log outputs, upstream
proxies and CDNs. Apply equivalent filtering to every output that records
request details; a default runtime log filter alone does not configure separate
access log encoders. Caddy's default sensitive-header redaction does not remove
sensitive URL query parameters.
[Caddy log documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/log)

OAuth authorization URLs contain `state` and redirect parameters; consent URLs
contain a single-use authorization key. Authorization codes, bearer tokens,
passwords and form bodies also belong outside logs. Keep debug/trace logging
disabled during OAuth flows. Verify logging with disposable marker values for
both successful requests and upstream failures, including a `Referer` carrying
a consent URL.

## 4b. Expose via Tailscale Funnel

```bash
sudo tailscale funnel --bg 8000
```

This publishes `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` (TLS certificate managed by
Tailscale) to the **public internet** and proxies it to `127.0.0.1:8000`. Check with:

```bash
tailscale funnel status
```

Funnel must be enabled for this node in your tailnet's admin console first
(**Settings → Funnel** at [login.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com)) - unlike
`tailscale serve`, it's not on by default. If `tailscale funnel` refuses to start, this is
almost always why.

Make sure `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in step 2 matches this URL exactly, then (re)start the
service so it picks up the value:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

## 4c. Alternative: Cloudflare Tunnel

> **Verification status: partially tested - feedback wanted.** This recipe should
> work, but it has **not** been tested end to end: the maintainers had no domain on
> Cloudflare, so a *named* tunnel with a stable hostname and a real Claude client were
> never tried together. What *was* tested (a quick tunnel and a scripted OAuth client)

> or on issue [#71](https://github.com/Vando-sketch/Nextcloud-Organizer-MCP/issues/71).

Use this instead of step 4a or 4b when you cannot open inbound ports (for example behind CGNAT)
or do not want to use Tailscale. [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)
opens an **outbound** connection to Cloudflare, and Cloudflare serves a public HTTPS
hostname that it forwards through that connection to the server.

```
Claude (custom connector, cloud-side)
        │  HTTPS (Cloudflare certificate)
        ▼
Cloudflare edge  ◄── outbound tunnel ──  cloudflared  ──►  nextcloud-organizer-mcp
                                                          (127.0.0.1:8000, plain HTTP)
```

Steps 1-3 (install, configure, systemd service) stay the same. Only the public URL
differs.

**Requirements:** a domain whose DNS is on Cloudflare (a free plan is enough). A named
tunnel needs a hostname under your own zone. Cloudflare's random `trycloudflare.com`
quick tunnels are for experiments only (see below).

### Set up a named tunnel

1. In the [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com) open
   **Networks → Tunnels → Create a tunnel**, choose **Cloudflared**, and name it.
2. On your server, install `cloudflared` from
   [Cloudflare's package repository](https://pkg.cloudflare.com/) and run the install
   command the dashboard shows for your OS. It registers a `cloudflared` systemd service
   that starts on boot with your tunnel token.
3. Add a **Published application route**:
   - Subdomain and domain: pick the domain **from the dropdown**, for example
     `organizer.example.com`.
   - Service type `HTTP`, URL `127.0.0.1:8000`. Use `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`,
     because the server only binds IPv4 loopback.
4. In `/etc/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.env` set the public URL to exactly that hostname
   (scheme and host, no path, no trailing slash) and restart the server:

   ```bash
   PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://organizer.example.com
   MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD=<long random value>
   MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR=/var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/oauth-state
   MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
   MCP_PORT=8000
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nextcloud-organizer-mcp
   ```

5. Add the connector in Claude with the URL `https://organizer.example.com/mcp`
   (see [Connect Claude](#5-connect-claude)).

The tunnel token is a credential: anyone holding it can run a connector for your tunnel.
If it leaks, delete the tunnel in the dashboard and create a new one.

### What becomes public

The whole server becomes reachable from the internet at your hostname, exactly as with
Funnel. Cloudflare does not add authentication on its own here. The server's OAuth 2.1
flow and the `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` consent page are the protection, which is why the server
refuses to start without the password on a non-localhost `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Do not put
**Cloudflare Access** in front of the hostname: Claude's connector cannot complete an
Access login, so the connection is expected to fail (untested). Keep the server bound to
`127.0.0.1` so the tunnel is the only way in.

### Client addresses and the consent rate limit

The consent page limits failed password attempts per client IP. Uvicorn takes that
address from `X-Forwarded-For`, but only when the connection comes from a trusted
address, and by default that is `127.0.0.1` only (`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`).

- **`cloudflared` on the same host as the server (this recipe):** works as is. The
  server sees the real client address.
- **`cloudflared` on another host or in a container:** every request arrives from the
  tunnel host's address, so all visitors share one rate-limit bucket. Ten wrong attempts
  from anyone would then lock the owner out of the consent page too. Set
  `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` to the address `cloudflared` connects from, for example
  `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS=172.18.0.2`. Do not set it to `*` while the server is reachable
  by other means than the tunnel, because any client could then forge its address. This
  setting was checked in the Uvicorn source only, not run against a remote
  `cloudflared`.

### Quick tunnels are not a production setup

`cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8000` needs no account and prints a random
`https://<words>.trycloudflare.com` URL, but the URL changes every time the process
restarts. `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and the Claude connector would have to change with it.
Cloudflare also states that quick tunnels do not support Server-Sent Events. Use one only
to try the flow for a few minutes, never as a lasting setup.

### What has and has not been tested

Tested on 2026-09-30 with `nextcloud-organizer-mcp` 0.2.1, `cloudflared` 2026.9.3 on
Debian 12 (Linux amd64) and a Cloudflare **free** plan with Bot Fight Mode off. The tests
used a **quick tunnel** and a scripted OAuth client (Python `httpx`), not a real Claude
client, against a real Nextcloud instance:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| OAuth discovery (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) advertises the public `https://` URLs | Passed |
| `POST /mcp` without a token returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=...` | Passed |
| Dynamic Client Registration, `/authorize`, consent page, `/token` with PKCE | Passed |
| Read-only tool call (`list_task_lists`) over `POST /mcp` against real Nextcloud | Passed |
| Issued token still valid after two server restarts (persistent `MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR`) | Passed |
| Cloudflare challenge or HTML page in front of any OAuth or MCP endpoint | None seen (free plan, Bot Fight Mode off, default settings, scripted client) |
| Forged `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` do not bypass the consent rate limit; the server logged the real client address | Passed |
| A client-sent `CF-Connecting-IP` header | Rejected by Cloudflare itself with `403 error code: 1000` before it reaches the server |
| Standalone `GET /mcp` event stream | **Not delivered** through the quick tunnel: no headers for 15 s, no `: ping` events in 200 s. The server sends a keep-alive comment every 15 s when reached directly. Request/response calls were not affected. |

Not tested: a **named tunnel** with a stable hostname (only its connection and
dashboard-delivered route config were observed), the real Claude.ai or Claude Desktop
connector, Cloudflare Access, **Bot Fight Mode or Super Bot Fight Mode enabled**, WAF
rules, caching rules, tool calls that run longer than 100 seconds, and `cloudflared` on a
separate host. Cloudflare closes idle proxied connections after about 100 seconds, which
the server's 15-second keep-alive should stay under, but this was not confirmed through a
named tunnel.

### Cloudflare settings to check if something fails

- **Bot Fight Mode / Super Bot Fight Mode** can serve a JavaScript challenge that a
  non-browser client such as Claude's connector cannot solve. Turn it off for the zone, or
  on a paid plan exclude the OAuth and MCP paths with a WAF skip rule. This is untested.
- **Cloudflare Access** in front of the hostname breaks the connector (see above).
- **Caching:** do not add cache rules for this hostname. Discovery and token responses
  must never be cached. The default showed `cf-cache-status: DYNAMIC`.

## 5. Connect Claude

### Claude.ai (web) — syncs to mobile automatically

**Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**, URL:
`https://organizer.example.com/mcp` for Caddy, or
`https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp` for Funnel. Leave any Client ID/Secret fields blank -
Dynamic Client Registration handles that. Approve the OAuth prompt that opens in your
browser. See the [Authentication](authentication.md#registering-the-connector-in-claude) for details.

### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop's remote-connector support goes through the
[`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) bridge, which handles the OAuth flow
locally (opens a browser for one-time auth). Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`
(`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nextcloud-organizer-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "https://organizer.example.com/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires Node.js. For Funnel, replace the hostname with your public Funnel hostname.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add nextcloud-organizer-mcp --transport http "https://organizer.example.com/mcp"
```

For Funnel, use `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/mcp` instead.

### Claude mobile (iOS/Android)

Add the connector on claude.ai web (above) - it syncs to mobile automatically. Connectors
can't be added directly from the mobile app.

## Local-only use (no public URL)

If the client runs on the same machine as the server, you can skip the public URL, TLS
and the consent password entirely. This works for clients that connect from your own
machine (Claude Code, Claude Desktop through the `mcp-remote` bridge, MCP Inspector). It
does **not** work for the Claude.ai web or mobile connector, see
[below](#why-a-cloud-hosted-connector-cannot-use-it). Even simpler for such clients: the
[native stdio transport](#native-stdio-transport) needs no URL, port or OAuth at all.

### Configure

```bash
NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=<nextcloud user>
NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD=<app password>

PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1
MCP_PORT=8000
# MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD is not needed here
MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR=$HOME/.local/state/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/oauth-state
```

The server does not read a `.env` file by itself; export the variables first:

```bash
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
uv run --no-dev nextcloud-organizer-mcp     # MCP endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

`MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` may be left out **only** when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` points at
`localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1` **and** `MCP_HOST` is one of those as well. This does
not switch OAuth off: clients still discover the server, register themselves
(Dynamic Client Registration), and exchange PKCE codes for tokens, and `/mcp` still
returns `401` without a valid token. Only the interactive consent page is skipped, so the
authorization completes without a prompt. Any process on the machine that can reach the
port can therefore obtain a token, so use this only on a machine you trust.

The check is enforced at startup. With no password, all of these refuse to start with
`MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD is required when PUBLIC_BASE_URL is not localhost or MCP_HOST is not
a local bind address`: `MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `MCP_HOST=<a LAN address>`, a public
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, and a LAN-address `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. Set a password to lift the
restriction for that case.

### Connect a local client

**Claude Desktop** (through [`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote), needs
Node.js). Use the absolute path to `npx`, because GUI apps do not inherit your shell
`PATH` (`which npx`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nextcloud-organizer-mcp": {
      "command": "/opt/homebrew/bin/npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The first start opens your browser for the authorization step, which completes
immediately. `mcp-remote` stores its tokens under `~/.mcp-auth/`.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude mcp add nextcloud-organizer-mcp --transport http http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp` inside Claude Code and authenticate the server once.

### Redirect domains

The OAuth redirect goes to the client's own loopback callback, and the server checks
its host against `MCP_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAINS`. When you leave that unset and
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is local, the default list is `claude.ai`, `claude.com` and
`localhost`. That covers clients that use `http://localhost:<port>/...` callbacks,
including `mcp-remote` (`http://localhost:<port>/oauth/callback`). A client that
registers `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...` instead is rejected with
`Redirect URI domain not allowed`; add `127.0.0.1` to
`MCP_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAINS` for such a client.

### Why a cloud-hosted connector cannot use it

Claude.ai (web and mobile) does not connect from your browser or phone. Anthropic's
servers perform the OAuth flow and every tool call. For those servers, `127.0.0.1` is
their own loopback interface, not your machine, so a `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` of
`http://127.0.0.1:8000` can never be reached. A cloud connector needs a public HTTPS URL
and `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`; use the [Tailscale Funnel setup](#4b-expose-via-tailscale-funnel)
above.

### Verified setup

Tested on 2026-09-30 against a real Nextcloud (CalDAV over HTTPS, app password), with
the server started as above from this repository:

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Server | 0.2.1, FastMCP 4.0.10, Python 3.12.13 |
| `mcp-remote` | 0.14.3 (`npx -y mcp-remote@0.14.3 http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`, no `--allow-http` needed for `127.0.0.1`) |
| Node.js | 26.4.0 |
| Claude Code | 2.1.285 (server added and reported `Needs authentication`; interactive `/mcp` login not run) |

With `mcp-remote`: discovery, registration and authorization completed without a consent
page (redirect `http://localhost:12570/oauth/callback`), a `list_task_lists` call returned
the Nextcloud task lists, and after a server restart the client reconnected without
authorizing again (tokens persist in `MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR`).

## Native stdio transport

With `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` the client starts the server as a child process and talks to
it over stdin/stdout. There is no port, no `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, no OAuth, no
`MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR`, no browser step, and no `mcp-remote` or Node.js. Use it when the
client runs on the same machine as the server (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, MCP
Inspector). It does **not** help Claude.ai web or mobile, which still need the HTTP
server behind a public URL (steps 1-5 above).

`MCP_TRANSPORT` is `http` when unset, so existing deployments do not change. On stdio the
server needs only the three Nextcloud variables and does not use `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`,
`MCP_OAUTH_*`, `MCP_HOST` or `MCP_PORT`. Every other setting (for example
`NEXTCLOUD_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`) still applies, and
`NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL` must still be `https://`.

The client passes the settings in its config (`env`), because a client-launched process
does not read your shell profile or a `.env` file.

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/` on macOS).
GUI apps do not inherit your shell `PATH`, so `command` must be an **absolute path** to
`uv` (find it with `which uv`). This example runs a checkout:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nextcloud-organizer-mcp": {
      "command": "/Users/you/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run", "--no-dev",
        "--project", "/Users/you/nextcloud-organizer-mcp",
        "nextcloud-organizer-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL": "https://cloud.example.com",
        "NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME": "your-username",
        "NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD": "your-app-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Once a release that includes stdio is on PyPI (anything after 0.2.1), you can drop the
checkout and use `"command": "/Users/you/.local/bin/uvx"` with
`"args": ["nextcloud-organizer-mcp"]`.

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add nextcloud-organizer-mcp \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password \
  -- uv run --no-dev --project /path/to/nextcloud-organizer-mcp nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

A terminal client finds `uv` on your `PATH`, so no absolute path is needed.

### MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your-username \
  -e NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password \
  uv run --no-dev --project /path/to/nextcloud-organizer-mcp nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

### What it costs

- **Secrets.** The Nextcloud app password sits in plaintext in each client's config
  (`env`) instead of in one `600` env file. Use a dedicated app password per client, so
  you can revoke one without touching the others.
- **Processes.** Every client session starts its own server process, so several clients
  multiply the connections to Nextcloud. The process exits when the client closes stdin,
  including when the client is killed, so it is not left running.
- **Logs.** stdout carries only protocol messages. Logging goes to stderr, which clients
  collect in their own log (for Claude Desktop, `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-*.log`
  on macOS).
- **Scope.** stdio does not help Claude.ai web or mobile. It is also not what the Docker
  image documents: see [Running in Docker](docker.md) for the HTTP setup.

> **Verification status.** The transport is covered by automated tests, including a real
> server process over pipes (`tests/test_stdio.py`) and a read-only call against a real
> Nextcloud (`tests/test_integration.py`, opt-in, see [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md)). The Claude
> Desktop, Claude Code and MCP Inspector configs above have not been run by the
> maintainers. Reports are welcome, see the
> [client compatibility report](https://github.com/Vando-sketch/Nextcloud-Organizer-MCP/issues/new/choose).

## Managing issued OAuth tokens

`oauth_tokens.json` (in `MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR`) accumulates one access/refresh token pair
per authorized client for as long as they stay valid - by default, access tokens expire
after `MCP_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS` (30 days) and refresh tokens after
`MCP_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS` (180 days, see `.env.example`), but there is no
built-in way to end a session early - e.g. after a lost device, or to confirm what's
actually been issued. `nextcloud-organizer-mcp-admin` (installed alongside the server by `uv
sync`) reads and edits `oauth_tokens.json` directly, without needing the server running:

```bash
# List every issued access/refresh token (truncated - full values are never printed),
# its client_id, and expiry. Defaults to $MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR, or .oauth-state/ if unset.
nextcloud-organizer-mcp-admin --state-dir /var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/oauth-state list

# Revoke one token (and its paired access/refresh token) by prefix, as shown by `list`.
# Claude will need to reconnect the connector (re-run the OAuth flow) afterwards.
nextcloud-organizer-mcp-admin --state-dir /var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/oauth-state revoke pat_a1b2c3
```

Stop the `nextcloud-organizer-mcp` service first if you want to be certain there's no
in-flight write racing the CLI's edit (both write the same file); the CLI itself always
rewrites `oauth_tokens.json` atomically-enough for a single-operator workflow (open,
truncate, write, `chmod 0600`), matching the permissions `PersonalAuthProvider` itself
uses.

## Updating

```bash
cd ~/nextcloud-organizer-mcp
git pull
uv sync --locked --no-dev
sudo systemctl restart nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

## Migrating from nextcloud-task-mcp

The project used to be called `nextcloud-task-mcp`. The old
`nextcloud-task-mcp` and `nextcloud-task-mcp-admin` commands are still
installed as deprecated aliases, so an existing deployment keeps running after
a plain `git pull && uv sync --locked --no-dev && sudo systemctl restart
nextcloud-task-mcp`. To move it over to the new names (the OAuth state is kept,
so Claude does not need to reconnect):

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now nextcloud-task-mcp

# Env file and persisted OAuth state
sudo mv /etc/nextcloud-task-mcp.env /etc/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.env
sudo mv /var/lib/nextcloud-task-mcp /var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp
sudo sed -i 's#/var/lib/nextcloud-task-mcp#/var/lib/nextcloud-organizer-mcp#' \
    /etc/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.env

# systemd unit: rename it, then point it at the new names
sudo mv /etc/systemd/system/nextcloud-task-mcp.service \
    /etc/systemd/system/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.service
sudo sed -i 's/nextcloud-task-mcp/nextcloud-organizer-mcp/g' \
    /etc/systemd/system/nextcloud-organizer-mcp.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now nextcloud-organizer-mcp
journalctl -u nextcloud-organizer-mcp -n 20
```

The unit's `WorkingDirectory` and `ReadWritePaths` still point at the old
checkout directory; that keeps working. To rename the checkout as well, `mv`
it and update both lines before the `daemon-reload`. If the GitHub repository was
renamed, `git remote set-url origin` to the new URL (GitHub also redirects the
old one).

## Troubleshooting

Find the class of failure first, then the row. Every class can be checked with
the matching step of the [shared verification checklist](deployment-verification.md#shared-checklist).

### Run the deployment check

`nextcloud-organizer-mcp-doctor` (installed with the server) checks a public URL the
way a remote MCP client sees it: DNS, TLS, the `401` challenge on `/mcp`, OAuth
discovery, whether the advertised URLs match the URL you checked, and whether
`/register`, `/authorize`, `/token` and `/consent` reach the server. Give it
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or the connector URL, and run it from **outside** the server's
network when you can, since that is where cloud clients connect from:

```bash
nextcloud-organizer-mcp-doctor https://organizer.example.com
# Docker, without installing anything:
docker run --rm --entrypoint nextcloud-organizer-mcp-doctor \
    ghcr.io/vando-sketch/nextcloud-organizer-mcp https://organizer.example.com
```

```text
[PASS] URL: connector URL https://organizer.example.com/mcp, PUBLIC_BASE_URL https://organizer.example.com
...
[PASS] TLS: certificate for organizer.example.com accepted
[FAIL] MCP endpoint: the challenge advertises http://127.0.0.1:8000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp: origin http://127.0.0.1:8000 instead of https://organizer.example.com, a localhost address
       -> The server builds these URLs from PUBLIC_BASE_URL alone: set it to exactly https://organizer.example.com (no /mcp) and restart the server.
```

Each failure names what answered instead (Nextcloud, a Cloudflare challenge, another
login layer, a proxy that cannot reach the backend) and what to change. It exits `0`
when nothing failed (warnings allowed), `1` when a check failed and `2` on usage
errors.

The checks are read-only and unauthenticated: they never register a client, start an
authorization or submit the consent form, so they create no OAuth state and do not
count against the consent rate limits. A pass does **not** prove that OAuth consent or
Nextcloud access work. Finish the check by adding the connector in your client,
entering `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` on the consent page and running a read-only tool such as
`list_task_lists`.

Without the tool, `curl -i https://<host>/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` from
outside the server's network is the quickest manual test: valid JSON with your public
`https://` URLs means URL, TLS and routing for discovery are right.

### Public URL mismatch

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Claude.ai says "error connecting" while adding the connector | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` doesn't exactly match the public HTTPS origin; or the endpoint isn't publicly reachable. Check DNS/TLS and proxy routing, or `tailscale funnel status` for Funnel. |
| Discovery URLs show `http://`, a backend IP or another host (Cloudflare Tunnel and proxies alike) | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` does not exactly match the public `https://` hostname (no path, no `/mcp`); fix it and restart the server. |
| Service fails to start: `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD is required...` | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` isn't localhost and `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` is unset - this is enforced deliberately, set the password (step 2) |
| Local setup: service refuses to start with `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD is required...` | `MCP_HOST` is not a loopback address (e.g. `0.0.0.0`) or `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is not loopback; set a password, or bind to `127.0.0.1` |
| Local setup: `Missing required environment variable` although a `.env` exists | The server does not read `.env` itself; `set -a; . ./.env; set +a` before starting |

### TLS termination

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| TLS certificate error or connection timeout | Check the hostname's A and AAAA records, inbound ports 80/443, certificate issuance logs and client trust. A stale AAAA record can send clients to the wrong host. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel: hostname returns Cloudflare error `1033` or `502` | `cloudflared` is not running or not connected (`systemctl status cloudflared`, `journalctl -u cloudflared`), or the route's service URL does not match where the server listens (`127.0.0.1:8000`) |
| Cloudflare Tunnel: the hostname does not resolve | The published route was saved with a typed or placeholder domain instead of one picked from the dropdown; check that the route shows a real hostname under your zone |
| Cloudflare Tunnel: discovery returns HTML, `403` or `503` instead of JSON | A Cloudflare challenge, bot protection or Access policy sits in front of the hostname; check **Security → Events** in the dashboard and the settings above |
| `tailscale funnel` refuses to start | Funnel not enabled for this node in the tailnet admin console (Settings → Funnel) |

### Redirect allow-list

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| OAuth prompt appears but authorization fails | The consent page rejected the submitted `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`; retry the form with the configured password. If authorization fails before the consent page appears, check that the redirect domain is in `MCP_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAINS` (only relevant if you changed the default). See [Authentication](authentication.md) for the consent flow. |
| Local setup: `Redirect URI domain not allowed` during authorization | The client registered a `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/...` callback; add `127.0.0.1` to `MCP_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAINS` (see [Local-only use](#local-only-use-no-public-url)) |

### Routing

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Discovery or consent returns `404`, or Nextcloud HTML | The proxy routes only `/mcp`, strips a path prefix that `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` does not contain, or selects the Nextcloud virtual host. Route all paths for the dedicated MCP hostname. |
| Subpath deployment: the client reports no authorization server, or registration fails with Nextcloud HTML | The root-level discovery paths for the prefix are not forwarded to MCP, or a Nextcloud `/.well-known` rule catches them first. See [the subpath rules](#serve-under-a-path-on-the-nextcloud-hostname). |
| Subpath deployment: `404` on `/organizer/mcp` from MCP itself | The proxy forwards the prefix instead of stripping it. |
| All users share a consent `429`, or changing `X-Forwarded-For` bypasses it | Review forwarded-header trust: MCP must trust the actual proxy peer and the proxy must replace untrusted incoming headers. Repeat the two-client and spoofing checks. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel: consent page answers `429` for everyone | `cloudflared` runs on another host, so all clients share one address; set `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` (see above) |

### Streaming

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Streams stall or disconnect through the proxy | Check inherited buffering and response/idle deadlines at every proxy hop; run the streaming checklist. |
| Cloudflare Tunnel: long-running calls or the event stream drop | Cloudflare closes idle connections after about 100 s, and quick tunnels do not stream events; use a named tunnel and check that the client reconnects |

### Tokens, state and Nextcloud

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `401` calling `/mcp` after Claude was previously connected | Access token expired or was revoked; disconnect and reconnect the connector in Claude to re-run the OAuth flow |
| `404` on `/mcp` right after a restart, then it works after reconnecting | The in-memory MCP session ended with the restart; the client must initialize a new session. The issued OAuth token stays valid if `MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR` persists. |
| OAuth state lost after a restart | `MCP_OAUTH_STATE_DIR` isn't pointing at a persistent, writable path - confirm the systemd `StateDirectory` is set and matches |
| "Nextcloud rejected the CalDAV credentials" | Wrong username or expired/revoked app password |
| "Could not reach the Nextcloud server" | Nextcloud down, or the container can't resolve/route to it |

Server logs: `journalctl -u nextcloud-organizer-mcp -f`. Unexpected internal errors are logged
there with full tracebacks, while the MCP client only ever sees a short generic message.
