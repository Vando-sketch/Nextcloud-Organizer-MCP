Ask in plain language, and your own Nextcloud changes. No copy-paste, no
third-party calendar service: the data stays on your server and the tools talk
to it over standard CalDAV and the Notes REST API.

## What you can say

| You say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "Add a high-priority task: finish the Q4 report by Thursday 5pm, remind me 2 hours before." | `create_task` with due date, priority and a `VALARM` reminder |
| "Add a weekly team sync, Mondays 10:00." | `create_event` with an `RRULE` |
| "Block Thursday 9-11 for the report." | `create_event_from_task` &mdash; a linked time block, task and event stay connected |
| "What does my Thursday look like?" | `get_agenda` &mdash; events (recurring ones expanded) and due tasks in one answer |
| "Start a note for the Q4 report, then update just the status section." | `create_note`, `update_note_section` |

What Claude wrote shows up in the normal Nextcloud apps, immediately:

## Features

- **Tasks** (VTODO): priorities, tags, reminders, subtasks, recurrence with exception dates, four-state status, batch update/delete/move.
- **Calendars and events** (VEVENT): recurring events, attendees and RSVP, free/busy, sharing, ICS import/export, birthdays, batch operations, trash bin.
- **Timeboxing**: turn a task into a calendar block and keep both linked.
- **Notes**: create, search, append, replace a passage or a single Markdown section.
- **Combined day agenda**: events and due tasks together.
- **Safe by default**: OAuth 2.1 with a password consent page, `https://` enforced for Nextcloud, clean error messages instead of stack traces.
- **51 tools** in total, documented in the [tool reference](docs/tools.md).

## Compatibility

| Client | Status |
|---|---|
| Claude (claude.ai web) as a custom connector | Supported, connector and consent flow tested against claude.ai |
| Claude mobile and Cowork | Use the same connector as web; not tested separately |
| Claude Desktop via [`mcp-remote`](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote) | Documented in the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md#5-connect-claude) |
| Other MCP clients and model providers | Not tested yet, planned |

The server speaks standard Streamable HTTP MCP with OAuth 2.1 (Dynamic Client
Registration + PKCE), so other clients may work. The OAuth redirect allow-list
defaults to `claude.ai` and `claude.com`; other clients need
`MCP_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECT_DOMAINS` set. Reports from other clients are welcome.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10+ and a Nextcloud with the Calendar/Tasks and Notes apps.

```bash
uv tool install nextcloud-organizer-mcp   # or: pipx install nextcloud-organizer-mcp
```

Create an app password under **Settings → Security → Devices & sessions** (never
your account password), then set:

```bash
export NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com
export NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=your-username
export NEXTCLOUD_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
export PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://organizer.example.com   # the URL clients use, no /mcp
export MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD=a-long-random-password  # required unless local
```

```bash
nextcloud-organizer-mcp     # listens on 127.0.0.1:8000, path /mcp
```

Prefer containers? A multi-arch image is on GHCR and needs no Python or uv; see
[Running in Docker](docs/docker.md) for a compose file and a `docker run` one-liner.

From a checkout instead: `uv sync && cp .env.example .env`, edit `.env`, then
`set -a; . ./.env; set +a; uv run nextcloud-organizer-mcp` (the server does not read
`.env` itself, so the variables must be exported first). Every setting is documented in
[`.env.example`](.env.example). `NEXTCLOUD_BASE_URL` must be `https://` unless it
points at a local address.

## Choose a deployment

Pick the row that matches your environment. The first question is where your Claude
client runs:

- **Claude.ai (web), Claude mobile and Cowork** are cloud-hosted. Anthropic's servers
  call your server, so it needs a **public HTTPS URL** and `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`. Use one
  of the first five rows.
- **Claude Desktop and Claude Code on the same machine** can reach `localhost`. They need
  no public URL and no password. Use one of the last two rows.

| Option | Prerequisites | Exposure and authentication | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Existing reverse proxy or shared Nextcloud host](docs/deployment.md#reuse-another-existing-nextcloud-proxy) | A proxy you already run with TLS on the same host, a new subdomain | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Not tested (nginx, Traefik) |
| [Path on the Nextcloud hostname](docs/deployment.md#serve-under-a-path-on-the-nextcloud-hostname) | A proxy for the Nextcloud hostname that can strip a path prefix | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (local Caddy and real Nextcloud; no public run, no Claude.ai) |
| [New public server with Caddy](docs/deployment.md#caddy-on-the-same-host) | A host with a public IP, ports 80 and 443 open, a DNS name | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (local Caddy only, no public run) |
| [Cloudflare Tunnel](docs/deployment.md#4c-alternative-cloudflare-tunnel) | A domain on Cloudflare; no open ports, works behind CGNAT | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Partially tested (quick tunnel and scripted client; standalone `GET /mcp` stream failed on the quick tunnel) |
| [Tailscale Funnel](docs/deployment.md#4b-expose-via-tailscale-funnel) | A Tailscale account with Funnel enabled | Public HTTPS. `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` required | Supported, tested with claude.ai |
| [Local HTTP](docs/deployment.md#local-only-use-no-public-url) | Client on the same machine, Node.js for `mcp-remote` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` only, no password. Any local process can get a token | Supported, tested with `mcp-remote` |
| [Native stdio](docs/deployment.md#native-stdio-transport) | Client on the same machine that can start a process | No port, no OAuth. Client starts the server | Supported, automated tests; client configs not run by the maintainers |

Prefer containers? [Running in Docker](docs/docker.md) is an alternative to installing
from PyPI. It only replaces the install; the public rows above still apply for exposure.
"Supported" means the recipe has been verified end to end; the
[verification checklist](docs/deployment-verification.md) records what was tested for
each row and what is still pending. Everything else should work but is
not confirmed, so reports are welcome.

Once you have a public URL, add it in Claude under
**Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** with the URL `<PUBLIC_BASE_URL>/mcp`.
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is the bare origin (for example `https://organizer.example.com`, no
`/mcp`); the connector URL adds the `/mcp` path. Leave Client ID and Secret blank
and enter your `MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` on the consent page that opens. Details:
[Authentication](docs/authentication.md#registering-the-connector-in-claude).

## How it works

```
Claude ── HTTPS + OAuth 2.1 ──► your server (this project) ── CalDAV / Notes API ──► Nextcloud
```

- One CalDAV connection is opened at startup and reused for every request.
- No tool or CalDAV logic runs until a request carries a valid access token.
- The server binds to a local HTTP port and does not handle TLS itself.
- Timestamps use `MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` (default `Europe/Berlin`); naive inputs are interpreted in it.
