# Vendored from https://github.com/crumrine/fastmcp-personal-auth
# (commit as of 2026-07-08, file personal_auth.py), with six local
# patches (see "LOCAL PATCHES" below) - otherwise unmodified.
#
# fastmcp-personal-auth is not published as an installable package - its own
# README instructs consumers to copy this module directly into their project.
# It is included here verbatim (plus the documented patches) rather than
# reformatted so that future updates can be diffed against upstream.
#
# LOCAL PATCHES (patches 1-2 applied 2026-07-09, patches 3-5 applied
# 2026-07-10, patch 6 applied 2026-10-13), all confirmed by live reproduction
# against a running instance, not just code review:
#
# 1. PersonalAuthProvider.authorize() had an "auto-approve for allowed
#    redirect domains" fallback in its password check that unconditionally
#    evaluated True, because authorize() already returns earlier (via
#    _is_redirect_allowed's raise) whenever that same condition is False.
#    This made MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD a no-op: any password (or none at all) was
#    accepted as long as the redirect domain matched the allow-list. Combined
#    with Dynamic Client Registration being open by design, this let an
#    anonymous script (no browser, no real claude.ai session) self-issue a
#    valid access token against a publicly-reachable deployment. The dead
#    fallback has been removed so the password, when configured, is actually
#    enforced.
#
# 2. The password check accepted the password via either the `scope` or
#    `state` OAuth parameter. Unlike `state`, `scope` is persisted verbatim
#    onto the issued access token AND refresh token (and echoed back in the
#    /token response body), meaning a password sent this way would end up
#    durably written to disk in oauth_tokens.json for the life of the token,
#    multiplying at-rest plaintext copies of the one secret this deployment
#    relies on. The `scope` channel has been removed; only `state` (never
#    persisted) is checked now.
#
# 3. oauth_tokens.json holds plaintext bearer and refresh tokens, but was
#    written with whatever the process umask left it at - commonly
#    world-readable - and the state dir was created without an explicit mode.
#    The state dir is now created (and chmod'd - Path.mkdir(mode=...) is
#    masked by the umask and, unlike chmod, does not fix an already-existing
#    directory's permissions) as 0o700, and oauth_tokens.json is now written
#    via os.open(..., 0o600) so it's never briefly or permanently
#    group/world-readable.
#
# 4. Refresh tokens were minted with `expires_at=None` - i.e. they never
#    expire, so a single leak of oauth_tokens.json grants indefinite access
#    even after the leak is noticed (D5). A new constructor parameter,
#    `refresh_token_expiry_seconds` (default 180 days;
#    `PersonalAuthProvider(..., refresh_token_expiry_seconds=None)` restores
#    the original never-expires behavior for anyone who wants it), is now
#    applied when a refresh token is first issued in
#    `exchange_authorization_code`.
#
#    Investigation of the base class before patching: `InMemoryOAuthProvider
#    .load_refresh_token` (inherited unmodified here) already correctly
#    enforces whatever `expires_at` is set on a `RefreshToken` - it checks
#    `expires_at is not None and expires_at < time.time()` and revokes the
#    pair, returning None - so once a refresh token actually carries an
#    `expires_at`, expiry is enforced with no override needed there.
#
#    However, `InMemoryOAuthProvider.exchange_refresh_token` (the token
#    *rotation* path, used every time a refresh token is redeemed) mints its
#    *replacement* refresh token using that module's own
#    `DEFAULT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS = None` constant, which is not
#    parameterized and can't be overridden by a subclass short of
#    reimplementing the method - so without further changes, the very first
#    refresh token would expire on schedule but every token it rotates into
#    would silently revert to "never expires", defeating the bound. This
#    class now overrides `exchange_refresh_token` to call `super()` (so the
#    rotation, scope validation, and old-token revocation logic stays
#    upstream's) and then re-stamp the newly-issued refresh token's
#    `expires_at` from `self.refresh_token_expiry_seconds` before persisting
#    state.
#
# 5. The MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD gate expected the OAuth *client* to embed the
#    password in the `state` parameter of /authorize. Live test against
#    production claude.ai (2026-07-10, real "Add custom connector" flow, the
#    /authorize request captured in the browser's DevTools network tab):
#    Claude sends its own randomly generated CSRF token as `state`
#    (e.g. "AfGKaeD8ijS45GgSdUH0KLgD0AAitxmZJozNMHVOTLo") and its connector
#    UI has no input that could influence it - so the gate denied every
#    legitimate authorization and the connector could never be set up. (It
#    did fail closed: an availability bug, not a bypass.) The `state` check
#    was unfixable rather than tunable, so it has been *replaced* by an
#    interactive consent page:
#
#      - authorize() no longer inspects `state`. When a password is
#        configured, it stashes the validated request (client + params) in
#        memory under a cryptographically random single-use pending key
#        (secrets.token_urlsafe(32), 10-minute TTL) and returns the URL of
#        GET /consent?pending=<key>. The MCP SDK's AuthorizationHandler
#        302-redirects the user's browser there (its contract is "provider
#        returns the next URL to redirect to" - it cannot serve HTML from
#        /authorize itself, which is why the form lives on its own route).
#      - GET /consent renders a password form (pending key as hidden field);
#        POST /consent verifies the password with secrets.compare_digest
#        (constant-time - the old `in` substring test was never a suitable
#        password comparison), then completes the original authorization via
#        the upstream super().authorize() path and 302s back to the client's
#        redirect_uri with the code and the client's own `state` intact.
#      - The form is a publicly reachable password oracle (the old design,
#        whatever else was wrong with it, never exposed one), so submissions
#        are rate-limited: max 5 wrong attempts per pending key (then the key
#        is invalidated and the flow must be restarted) and max 10 failures
#        per client IP per 15 minutes (then hard 429, even with the correct
#        password). Failed attempts do NOT consume the pending key below the
#        limit. Form data is never logged and never echoed into responses
#        (this deployment already disables Uvicorn's access log - see
#        docs/authentication.md - and the consent handlers keep that
#        guarantee: nothing the user types leaves the comparison).
#      - The routes are contributed by overriding FastMCP's
#        OAuthProvider.get_routes() hook, which the framework calls to
#        collect the auth router - OAuth discovery (/.well-known/*),
#        /register (DCR) and /token are untouched.
#
# 6. The consent form posted to a hardcoded root-relative action="/consent".
#    Behind a reverse proxy serving this server under a path prefix
#    (PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://cloud.example.com/organizer), GET /consent is
#    reached at /organizer/consent - authorize() already builds that URL from
#    base_url - but the form then submitted to https://cloud.example.com/consent,
#    outside the prefix, where the proxy hands it to whatever else owns the
#    domain (typically Nextcloud). The action is now base_url's path plus
#    /consent, which is unchanged ("/consent") for a root deployment.
