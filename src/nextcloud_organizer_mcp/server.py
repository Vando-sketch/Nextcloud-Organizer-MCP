            tag: Optional category/tag filter (exact match).
            search_text: Optional substring filter over title (title) and notes
                (notes). Both it and `tag` ignore case and Unicode spelling
                ("STRASSE" matches "Straße").
            without_reminder: If True, only return tasks with no reminders
                (empty `reminders`).
            without_visibility: If True, only return tasks with no visibility
                set (`visibility` is None, i.e. no readable CLASS property).
            without_tags: If True, only return tasks with no tags.
            uid_regex: Optional regular expression; only return tasks whose
                uid contains a match (`re.search`, case-sensitive - anchor
                with ^...$ for a full match, e.g. "^[A-F0-9-]+$" for the
                all-uppercase UUIDs iOS-created items carry). An invalid
                pattern is an error. It matches the stored uid: for a
                recurring task that is the series uid, never the synthetic
                "<uid>#<occurrence>" of an expanded row.
                These four filters exist for cleanup sweeps - items created
                by hand on a phone are recognizable by uppercase UUIDs and
                missing reminders/visibility/tags, and combining them
                shortlists those in one call.
            fields: Optional whitelist of result keys (see Returns for the
                vocabulary); every other key is omitted from each task dict.
                Unknown names error, an empty list means "no whitelist" (unlike
                an empty `list_names`, which is an empty scope). Use this to
                keep payloads small when you only need a few fields.
            compact: If True, omit keys whose value is None, [] or "" plus the
                rarely useful list_url (unless whitelisted via `fields`), and
                truncate notes to 200 characters (marked with "… [truncated
                ...]"; get_task returns the full text). Values are otherwise
                unchanged - an absent key just means empty/None. Combines with
                `fields` (whitelist first, then compaction).
            list_name: Deprecated alias for `list_names` (takes a single list display name).
                Pass `list_names` instead. Passing both `list_name` and `list_names`
                is an error.

        An empty string is "no filter" for every filter that takes one -
        priority, tag, search_text, uid_regex, due_before and due_after alike. (`limit`
        still rejects 0: omit it rather than ask for zero results.) An empty
        `list_names` list is an empty scope and returns nothing.

        If `due_before` and/or `due_after` is given, tasks with no readable
        due_date (due date) are excluded - they can't be judged "before"/"after"
        anything. Results are sorted by due_date ascending (those tasks last),
        then by title. `limit` is applied last, after merging across lists.

        Recurring tasks (recurrence) and `due_before`: a recurring task is
        stored once but is due many times, so when `due_before` is given it is
        expanded into one row per occurrence due inside the window - that is the
        only way "what is due next week" can include a weekly task started in
        March. Without `due_before` there is no window to expand into and the
        series is returned as the single row it is stored as, recurrence
        intact. At most 100 occurrences per task are produced.

        What an expanded row is, and is not: it is a read-only view of one date
        in a series. `recurrence_id` names its occurrence, `recurrence` is
        None, `series_uid` is the stored task's uid, and its own `uid` is a
        synthetic "<series_uid>#<occurrence>" that update_task, complete_task,
        delete_task and get_task all reject with an explanation. To act on the
        series, pass `series_uid` - but note that update_task changes every
        occurrence and complete_task ends the whole series (it does not roll it
        forward). To make the series skip one date, add that date to its
        exception_dates via update_task.

        Returns:
            A list of task dicts with keys: uid, title, start_date, due_date,
            priority, progress_percent, status ("open"/"in-progress"/
            "completed"/"cancelled" - see create_task/update_task's status

                back to start_date) or an absolute ISO 8601 datetime -> VALARM.
                The leading "-" is what makes a relative reminder fire *before*
                that date; a positive duration ("PT30M") is valid and means 30

            parent_task: Optional UID of an existing task to link this
                task to as a subtask -> RELATED-TO (RELTYPE=PARENT).
            recurrence: Optional recurrence rule as raw RFC 5545 RRULE text,
                e.g. "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO" -> RRULE. Requires the task to
                have a start_date or due_date (in this same call) to
                recur from - a task with neither is rejected.
            exception_dates: Optional ISO 8601 dates/datetimes of skipped
                occurrences of a recurring task -> EXDATE. Each entry must be
                the same value kind as the task's start_date (date-only for an
                all-day task, a full datetime otherwise) and must name an
                occurrence the recurrence actually produces; an entry that
                would cancel nothing is rejected rather than stored.
            status: Optional "open" / "in-progress" / "completed" / "cancelled" ->
                STATUS, for creating a task that is not simply open - importing
                an already-finished task, say, which otherwise took a
                create_task plus a complete_task. Omitted (the default) creates
                an open task. "completed" behaves like complete_task (also sets
                PERCENT-COMPLETE=100 and a COMPLETED timestamp of *now*, since
                the real completion time is not recorded anywhere to recover);
                "in-progress" and "cancelled" only set STATUS. An explicit
                progress_percent in the same call wins over the percentage
                status would otherwise derive.

        Date/time semantics for start_date and due_date: a value that is
        exactly "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g. "2026-07-20") creates an all-day entry
        (iCalendar VALUE=DATE). Any other ISO 8601 value is stored as a
        datetime; a *naive* datetime (no UTC offset, e.g.
        "2026-07-20T14:00:00") is interpreted in the server's default timezone
        (`MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`, default Europe/Berlin). A datetime may instead
        be followed by a space and an IANA timezone name, e.g.
        "2026-07-20T14:00:00 Europe/Berlin" - the correct offset (standard or
        daylight time) is then resolved for that specific date, so callers
        don't need to work out themselves whether e.g. CET or CEST applies.
        Combining a numeric offset with a timezone name is rejected.

            expand_recurrences: If True, expand recurring events into
                their individual occurrences within [start, end] (both bounds
                required); each occurrence carries recurrence_id.
            without_reminder: If True, only return events with no reminders
                (empty `reminders`).
            without_visibility: If True, only return events with no visibility
                set (`visibility` is None, i.e. no readable CLASS property).
            without_tags: If True, only return events with no tags.
            uid_regex: Optional regular expression; only return events whose
                uid contains a match (`re.search`, case-sensitive - anchor
                with ^...$ for a full match, e.g. "^[A-F0-9-]+$" for the
                all-uppercase UUIDs iOS-created events carry). An invalid
                pattern is an error, an empty string is no filter.
                These four filters exist for cleanup sweeps - events created
                by hand on a phone are recognizable by uppercase UUIDs and
                missing reminders/visibility/tags, and combining them
                shortlists those in one call. They narrow an already-queried
                window rather than widening it: with neither `calendar_names`
                nor a bound, the default window below still applies, so a
                sweep over older events needs `start`/`end` (or a calendar name)
                as well.
            fields: Optional whitelist of result keys (see Returns for the
                vocabulary); every other key is omitted from each event dict.
                Unknown names error, an empty list means "no whitelist". Use
                this to keep payloads small when you only need a few fields.
            compact: If True, omit keys whose value is None, [] or "" (e.g.
                attendees, organizer, recurrence on most events) and
                truncate description to 200 characters (marked with
                "… [truncated ...]"; get_event returns the full text). Values
                are otherwise unchanged - an absent key just means empty/None.
                Combines with `fields` (whitelist first, then compaction).

        Called with neither `calendar_names` nor a time bound, this would scan
        every event in the account; instead a default window of today ±90 days
        (in the server's default timezone) is applied. Pass `start` and/or `end`
        explicitly - or name a calendar - to query outside that window. Naming
        a calendar is a scoping decision, so it turns the default window off
        rather than narrowing it: `calendar_names` plus
        `expand_recurrences=True` and no bounds still fails with
        "requires both start and end", the same as before this default existed.

        Naive datetimes (no UTC offset) are interpreted in the server's default
        timezone (`MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE`, default Europe/Berlin), like everywhere else
        in this server.

        One call instead of create_event plus an update_event per person: the
        title, recurrence, tag, visibility and reminders are not parameters
        here, they are the convention every entry in the birthday calendar
        follows. What gets written:

        - Title "🎂 <name> (<birth year>)" - without the parentheses when no
          birth year is known.
        - An all-day, one-day event starting on the *birth* date, so each
          occurrence's year minus the start year is the age being celebrated.
          Without a birth year it starts on the next upcoming occurrence.
        - recurrence "FREQ=YEARLY", tags ["Birthday"], visibility
          "private", reminders ["-PT0M", "-P1D"] (on the day itself and the
          day before). Entries written to the legacy "Geburtstage" calendar
          are tagged "Geburtstag" instead, matching the entries already in
          it, so one tag still covers the whole calendar.

        Args:
            name: The person's name, without the cake and without the year
                (both are added). Passing a title read back from an existing
                entry ("🎂 Dad (1975)") works too - the cake is not doubled
                and the year in parentheses is read as the birth year.
            date: The birthday as "MM-DD" (e.g. "07-04"), or as a full
                "YYYY-MM-DD" whose year is the year of BIRTH. Never fill in
                the current (or next) year to turn "on the 4th of July" into
                a full date - that is the year of the next celebration, not a
                birth year, and it would make the person 0 years old. Pass
                "MM-DD" whenever the birth year is unknown. A 02-29 birthday
                stays 02-29, and a yearly rule then only fires in leap years -
                pass 02-28 or 03-01 instead if the entry should show up every
                year.
            year: Optional year of birth (e.g. 1975), only ever a year the
                person was actually born in. May instead come from `date` or
                from a trailing "(1975)" in `name`; naming it twice is fine as
                long as the values agree, and conflicting values are an error.
                An unknown birth year is fine - leave it out and the title
                carries no year. A birth date that is still ahead is rejected.
            calendar: Display name of the target calendar. Left out, it is
                "Birthdays", except on a server that still has the
                "Geburtstage" calendar an earlier version of this tool wrote
                to and no "Birthdays" - there the existing calendar is used,
                so birthdays stay in one place instead of being split across
                two. Naming a calendar explicitly always uses that one.

        REPLACES an event's whole exception list, so it has to be handed every

        Cancelling a day on several series at once (sick leave, holiday, a
        block of school days) is the case it is built for: pass every affected
        UID and the days themselves.

                whatever time the series starts - so the same list of days
                works across series with different start times. An exact
                ISO 8601 datetime cancels that one occurrence. Dates the event
                already skips are left as they are.
            remove: Exception dates to remove, so the occurrence happens again.
                Same forms as `add`; a plain "YYYY-MM-DD" removes every
                exception date the event has on that day.

        one match is an error and nothing is changed. On an "occurs N

        same context repeated in `new_text`) so it matches exactly once.
